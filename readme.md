## 1. General

Creates `{playlist name}.m3u` playlist files based of the direct child directories. Playlist names are the child directory's names and content are the music files they contain. The results are saved in `./m3u`.  
By default files with the following file extension are recognised as music files:
- `.m4a`
- `.mp3`
- `.wav`

You may set `LIBRARY_PATH` if you you want any path prefixes in the playlist file.
